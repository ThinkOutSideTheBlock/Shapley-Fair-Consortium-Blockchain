# Reduced Experimental Configuration for Publication
# Purpose: Feasible parameter sweep for preprint submission
# Estimated runtime: 5-7 days on 8-core workstation (15,360 total runs)
# Trade-off: Strategic reduction while maintaining statistical power

run_id: "shapley_consortium_publishable"
random_seed: 42
log_level: "INFO"

# Output configuration
output_dir: "experiments/publishable_run"
parallel_workers: 8
checkpoint_interval: 100

# Monte Carlo settings
n_iterations: 1  # Single iteration per configuration for initial sweep
n_mc_samples: 5000  # High quality MC approximation

# STRATEGICALLY REDUCED PARAMETER GRID
# Total combinations: 3 × 3 × 2 × 4 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 4 = 15,552 runs
# Runtime estimate: ~2-3 seconds per run = 43,200 seconds = 12 hours on 8 cores

parameters:
  # Network size (REDUCED from 4 to 3 levels)
  # Rationale: Drop n=10 (exact Shapley infeasible), focus on consortium-relevant sizes
  n_agents: [4, 6, 8]

  # Contribution distribution (REDUCED from 4 to 3 levels)
  # Rationale: Cover low/medium/high, drop extreme values
  mu: [5.0, 10.0, 20.0]

  # Contribution heterogeneity (REDUCED from 3 to 2 levels)
  # Rationale: Keep low (homogeneous) vs high (heterogeneous)
  sigma_q: [2.0, 5.0]

  # Reporting noise (REDUCED from 5 to 4 levels)
  # Rationale: Cover truthful, low, medium, high noise
  sigma_report: [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0]

  # Detection probability (REDUCED from 4 to 3 levels)
  # Rationale: No enforcement, moderate, high enforcement
  detection_prob: [0.0, 0.5, 0.9]

  # Penalty factor (REDUCED from 4 to 3 levels)
  # Rationale: No penalty, moderate, severe
  penalty: [0.0, 1.0, 5.0]

  # Game structure (KEEP all 3 - critical for diversity)
  payoff_shapes: ["linear", "subadditive", "superadditive"]

  # Allocation methods (ALL 4 methods)
  allocation_methods:
    - "exact_shapley"           # Ground truth for small n
    - "mc_shapley"              # Standard MC baseline
    - "mc_shapley_stratified"   # Novel variance reduction
    - "weighted_shapley_owen"   # Novel weighted approach

  # Distribution type (FIXED to lognormal for consistency)
  q_dist: ["lognormal"]

  # Reporting model (FIXED to truthful for base analysis)
  report_model: ["truthful"]

# Optional: Enable Nash equilibrium for subset
# nash_equilibrium_subset: 0.1  # Compute for 10% of runs (expensive)

# Optional: Enable core membership checks
# core_membership_checks: true
